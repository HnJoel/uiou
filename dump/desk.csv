188,5,88,5,"+ Gershayim (Hebrew: גֵּרְשַׁיִם‎, without niqqud גרשיים‎), also occasionally grashayim (גְּרָשַׁיִם‎), is two distinct typographical marks in the Hebrew language."
189,5,88,5,"+ The name literally means ""double geresh""."
190,5,31,5,"+ The Masoretic Text (MT or 𝕸; Hebrew: נוסח המסורה, romanized: Nusakh Ham'mas'sora) is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in Rabbinic Judaism."
191,5,31,5,"+ It was primarily copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era (CE). The oldest known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates from the early 11th century CE."
192,5,31,5,"+ The Dead Sea Scrolls, dating to as early as the 3rd century BCE, contain versions of the text that are radically different from today's Hebrew Bible. "
193,5,31,5,"+ The Septuagint (a Koine Greek translation made in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and the Peshitta (a Syriac translation made in the 2nd century CE) occasionally present notable differences from the Masoretic Text, as does the Samaritan Pentateuch, the text of the Torah preserved by the Samaritans in Samaritan Hebrew. "
194,5,31,5,"+ Fragments of an ancient manuscript of the Book of Leviticus found near an ancient synagogue's Torah ark in Ein Gedi have identical wording to the Masoretic Text."
195,5,31,5,"+ The Masoretes began their work c. a.d. 500, and continued it almost to the time of the invention of printing."
196,5,81,5,"+ Shin (also spelled Šin (šīn) or Sheen) is the twenty-first letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician Shin 𐤔‎, Hebrew Shin ש‎, Aramaic Shin 𐡔‎, Syriac Shin ܫ, and Arabic Shin ش (in abjadi order, 13th in modern order). "
197,5,81,5,"+ Its sound value is a voiceless sibilant, [ʃ] or [s]."
198,5,81,5,"+ The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Sigma (Σ) (which in turn gave Latin S and Cyrillic С), and the letter Sha in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts (, Ш)."

203,5,47,2,"→ In some siddurs (e.g. those printed by ArtScroll) a diacritical symbol, typographically the same as the rafe, but utterly unrelated, is used to mark instances of ""moving sheva"" (Shva Na)."
204,5,47,5,"+ In Hebrew orthography the rafe or raphe (Hebrew: רָפֶה, pronounced [ʁaˈfe], meaning ""(literary) weak, limp; (grammar) lax"") is a diacritic (⟨ ֿ‎ ⟩), a subtle horizontal overbar placed above certain letters to indicate that they are to be pronounced as fricatives."
205,5,47,5,"+ It originated with the Tiberian Masoretes as part of the extended system of niqqud (vowel points), and has the opposite meaning of dagesh qal, showing that one of the letters בגדכפת is to be pronounced as a fricative and not as a plosive, or (sometimes) that a consonant is single and not double; or, as the opposite to a mappiq, to show that the letters ה or א are silent (mater lectionis)."
206,5,47,5,"+ The rafe generally fell out of use for Hebrew with the coming of printing, although according to Gesenius (1813) at that time it could still be found in a few places in printed Hebrew Bibles, where the absence of a dagesh or a mappiq was noticeable. (e.g. Exodus 20:13,14,15; Deuteronomy 5:13,17,18,19; 2 Samuel 11:1; Isaiah 22:10; Jeremiah 20:17; Psalm 119:99; Zechariah 5:11)"
207,5,47,3,"≈ The rafe is similar in function to the buailte (dot above, denoting lenition) in the old-style Irish alphabet."

210,5,51,5,"+ The sof passuk (Hebrew: סוֹף פָּסוּק‎, end of verse, also spelled sof pasuq and other variant English spellings, and sometimes called סילוק silluq) is the cantillation mark that occurs on the last word of every verse, or passuk, in the Tanakh. Some short verses contain only members of the sof passuk group."
211,5,51,5,"+ The sof passuk can be preceded by the marks mercha, tipcha, and mercha in that order, including either all or some of these. However, these merchot and tipchot do not necessarily have the same melody as those in the etnachta group. Altogether, there are five possible arrangements how these can appear."
212,5,2,5,"+ Segol (Hebrew: סְגוֹל֒   also known as Segolta, with variant English spellings), is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. "
213,5,2,5,"+ The Segol occurs together with a preceding Zarka, sometimes with a Munach preceding one or both."
214,5,2,5,"+ The Segol group is considered to be a disjunctive. It occurs in place of the Katan group or a Zakef gadol. It is the strongest disjunctive group ahead of the Etnachta group."
215,5,2,5,"+ The Hebrew word סְגוֹל֒ translates into English as bunch, referring to a bunch of grapes. This is reflected in its appearance as a three-dot symbol."
216,5,2,5,"+ The Israel people are called “am segulah,”a chosen people. "
217,5,2,5,"+ The segol represents the Sefirah of Chessed1—kindness—and is displayed as a triangle of three dots: right, left and center."
218,5,8,5,"+ Zarka or zarqa (Hebrew: זַרְקָא֮, with variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is usually found together with the Segol, with a Munach preceding either or both. The symbol for a Zarka is a 90 degrees rotated, inverted S. "
219,5,8,5,"+ The Hebrew word זַרְקָא֮‎ translates as ""throwing"" and the melody is ascending in Moroccan and Sefardic tradition (with two or one retracements respectively) and descending in the Ashkenazic."
220,5,8,5,"+ Zarka is part of the Segol group. In this group, Zarka is the connector and Segol is the separator."
221,5,8,5,"+ Zarqa, written postpositive to the word, is a distinctive accent used in 21 books of the Bible. "
222,5,8,5,"+ The same accent, also postpositive and also distinctive, is called Tsinor in the other 3 books."
223,5,8,5,"+ Such postpositive accents are usually positioned above left of the last letter of the word, but sometimes one may find them also on top of the last letter, with no effect on semantics."
224,5,30,5,"+ Tsinnorit (Hebrew: צִנּוֹרִת֘) is a cantillation mark in the Hebrew Bible, found at the 3 poetic books, also known as the א״מת books (Job or אִיוֹב in Hebrew, Proverbs or מִשְלֵי, and Psalms or תְהִלִּים). "
225,5,30,5,"+ It looks like a 90-degrees rotated, inverted S, placed on top of a Hebrew consonant. "
226,35,30,5,"+ Tsinnorit is very similar in shape to Zarka (called tsinnor in the poetic books), but is used differently. It is always combined with a second mark to form a conjunctive symbol:"
227,35,30,5,"+ Tsinnorit combines with (merkha to form merkha metsunneret, a rare variant of merkha that serves mainly sof pasuq."
228,35,30,5,"+ Tsinnorit combines with mahapakh to form mehuppakh metsunnar, also a rare mark, variant of mahapakh that serves mainly azla legarmeh but appears also in the other contexts where mahapakh and illuy appear."
229,35,30,5,"+ This mark has been wrongly named by Unicode. Zarqa/tsinnor corresponds to Unicode ""Hebrew accent zinor"", code point U+05AE (where ""zinor"" is a misspelled form for tsinnor), while tsinnorit maps to ""Hebrew accent zarqa"", code point U+0598."
230,35,30,5,"+ tsinnor (Hebrew, pipe or shaft) mentioned in the Bible in the description of David's conquest of the city (II Samuel 5:8)"

232,35,30,5,"+ 1) pipe, spout, conduit, water conduit"
233,35,30,5,"+ Tsinorit, written on top of a consonant in the beginning or the middle of the word, is a conjunctive accent in the 3 books."
234,35,30,5,"+ The names Tsinor and Tsinorit are both written with initial TSADI (U+05E6) and not with initial ZAYIN (U+05D6). Following the transcription for all other Hebrew names in Unicode, they should therefore be written with initial ""TS-"" instead of initial ""Z-""."
235,35,30,5,"+ Geminated consonants are never reflected in the transcription used for Unicode character names; therefore we write here consistently ""Tsinor"" and ""Tsinorit"" instead of the transcription ""Tsinnor(it)"" in the other chapters of this article."
236,5,9,5,"+ Pashta (Hebrew: פַּשְׁטָא֙‎) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is part of the Katan group. Its mark symbol is identical to that of the Kadma."
237,5,9,5,"While Kadma and Pashta use the same symbol, Pashta is distinct from Kadma in the placement of the symbol. Kadma is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter as well as on the accented syllable, if it's not the last."
238,5,9,5,"The Hebrew word פַּשְׁטָא֙‎ translates into English as stretching out."
239,5,24,5,"+ Kadma (Hebrew קַדְמָ֨א, with variant English spellings) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It can be found by itself preceding certain trope groups, or together with a Geresh, in which case, the pair is known as ""Kadma-V'Azla."""
240,5,24,5,"Kadma has the same symbol as the Pashta, though Kadma is distinct from Pashta in the placement of the symbol. In a Kadma, the symbol is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter and also on the accented syllable if the last syllable is not the accented one."
241,5,24,5,"The symbols for Kadma V'Azla are designed to resemble the fingers of an outstretched hand in a curved position."

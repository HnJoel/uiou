31,5,"+ <ol> <li> The Masoretic Text (MT or 𝕸; Hebrew: נֻסָּח הַמָּסוֹרָה, romanized: Nūssāḥ Hammāsōrā, lit. 'Text of the Tradition') is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter-text, with its vocalization and accentuation known as the mas'sora. Referring to the Masoretic Text, masorah specifically means the diacritic markings of the text of the Hebrew scriptures and the concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later printings) of the Tanakh which note textual details, usually about the precise spelling of words. It was primarily copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era (CE). The oldest known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates from the early 11th century CE. </li> <li> The differences attested to in the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate that multiple versions of the Hebrew scriptures already existed by the end of the Second Temple period. Which is closest to a theoretical Urtext is disputed, as is whether such a singular text ever existed. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dating to as early as the 3rd century BCE, contain versions of the text that contain some differences from today's Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint (a Koine Greek translation made in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and the Peshitta (a Syriac translation made in the 2nd century CE) occasionally present notable differences from the Masoretic Text, as does the Samaritan Pentateuch, the text of the Torah preserved by the Samaritans in Samaritan Hebrew. Fragments of an ancient manuscript of the Book of Leviticus found near an ancient synagogue's Torah ark in Ein Gedi have identical wording to the Masoretic Text. </li>  <li> The Masoretes began their work c. a.d. 500, and continued it almost to the time of the invention of printing. </li> <li> The Masoretic Text is the basis for most Protestant translations of the Old Testament such as the King James Version, English Standard Version, New American Standard Version, and New International Version. After 1943, it has also been used for some Catholic Bibles, such as the New American Bible and the New Jerusalem Bible. Some Christian denominations instead prefer translations of the Septuagint as it matches quotations in the New Testament. </li> </ol>"

6,5,"+ <ol> <li> Tifcha (Hebrew: טִפְחָ֖א, also spelled Tifkha, Tipcha and other variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark commonly found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books that are chanted. In Sephardic and Oriental traditions, it is called Tarcha, meaning ""dragging"" or ""effort"". </li> <li> The Tifcha is found in both the Etnachta group as the second member of that group, and in the Sof passuk group, though the melody varies slightly in each. While it is a weak sound, it is considered to be stronger than a Tevir </li> <li> The Hebrew word טִפְחָ֖א translates into English as diagonal. It is related to the word tefach (טפח, measurement of the palm). The tifcha does not have a separating value of its own, as it is in the middle of a set of words. </li> <li> Tifcha occurs in the Torah 11,285 times, more than any other trope sound. Tifcha is the only trope sound to appear more than 10,000 times in the Torah. </li>  <li> The first word of the Torah בראשית (Bereshit) is on a Tifcha. </li> </ol>"
81,5,"+ <ol> <li> Shin (also spelled Šin (šīn) or Sheen) is the twenty-first letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician šīn 𐤔, Hebrew šīn ש, Aramaic šīn 𐡔, Syriac šīn ܫ, and Arabic sīn س (in abjadi order, 13th in modern order). Its sound value is a voiceless sibilant, [ʃ] or [s]. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Sigma (Σ) (which in turn gave Latin S and Cyrillic С), and the letter Sha in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts (, Ш). </li> <li> The South Arabian and Ethiopian letter Śawt is also cognate. </li> </ol>"

65,5,"<ol> <li> Yodh (also spelled jodh, yod, or jod) is the tenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician yōd 𐤉, Hebrew yud י, Aramaic yod 𐡉, Syriac yōḏ ܝ, and Arabic yāʾ ي. Its sound value is /j/ in all languages for which it is used; in many languages, it also serves as a long vowel, representing /iː/. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Iota (Ι), Latin I and J, Cyrillic І, Coptic iauda (Ⲓ) and Gothic eis . </li> <li> The term yod is often used to refer to the speech sound [j], a palatal approximant, even in discussions of languages not written in Semitic abjads, as in phonological phenomena such as English ""yod-dropping"". </li> </ol>"
57,5,"+ <ol> <li> Bet, Beth, Beh, or Vet is the second letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician bēt 𐤁 , Hebrew bēt ב, Aramaic bēṯ 𐡁, Syriac bēṯ ܒ, and Arabic bāʾ ب. Its sound value is the voiced bilabial stop ⟨b⟩ or the voiced labiodental fricative ⟨v⟩. </li> <li> The letter's name means ""house"" in various Semitic languages (Arabic bayt, Akkadian bītu, bētu, Hebrew: bayīṯ, Phoenician bēt etc.; ultimately all from Proto-Semitic *bayt-), and appears to derive from an Egyptian hieroglyph of a house by acrophony. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to, among others, the Greek beta (Β, β), Latin B (B, b) and Cyrillic Be (Б, б) and Ve (В, в). </li> </ol>"
56,5,"+ <ol> <li> Aleph (or alef or alif, transliterated ʾ) is the first letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician ʾālep 𐤀, Hebrew ʾālef א, Aramaic ʾālap 𐡀, Syriac ʾālap̄ ܐ, Arabic ʾalif ا, and North Arabian 𐪑. It also appears as South Arabian 𐩱 and Ge'ez ʾälef አ. </li> <li> These letters are believed to have derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph depicting an ox's head to describe the initial sound of *ʾalp, the West Semitic word for ox (compare Biblical Hebrew אֶלֶף‎ ʾelef, "" ox""). The Phoenician variant gave rise to the Greek alpha (Α), being re-interpreted to express not the glottal consonant but the accompanying vowel, and hence the Latin A and Cyrillic А. </li> <li> Phonetically, aleph originally represented the onset of a vowel at the glottis. In Semitic languages, this functions as a prosthetic weak consonant, allowing roots with only two true consonants to be conjugated in the manner of a standard three consonant Semitic root. In most Hebrew dialects as well as Syriac, the aleph is an absence of a true consonant, a glottal stop ([ʔ]), the sound found in the catch in uh-oh. In Arabic, the alif represents the glottal stop pronunciation when it is the initial letter of a word. In texts with diacritical marks, the pronunciation of an aleph as a consonant is rarely indicated by a special marking, hamza in Arabic and mappiq in Tiberian Hebrew. In later Semitic languages, aleph could sometimes function as a mater lectionis indicating the presence of a vowel elsewhere (usually long). When this practice began is the subject of some controversy, though it had become well established by the late stage of Old Aramaic (ca. 200 BCE). Aleph is often transliterated as U+02BE ʾ , based on the Greek spiritus lenis ʼ; for example, in the transliteration of the letter name itself, ʾāleph. </li> </ol>"
80,5,"+ <ol> <li> Resh is the twentieth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician rēš 𐤓, Hebrew rēš ר, Aramaic rēš 𐡓‎, Syriac rēš ܪ, and Arabic rāʾ ر. Its sound value is one of a number of rhotic consonants: usually [r] or [ɾ], but also [ʁ] or [ʀ] in Hebrew and North Mesopotamian Arabic. </li> <li> In most Semitic alphabets, the letter resh (and its equivalents) is quite similar to the letter dalet (and its equivalents). In the Syriac alphabet, the letters became so similar that now they are only distinguished by a dot: resh has a dot above the letter, and the otherwise identical dalet has a dot below the letter. In the Arabic alphabet, rāʼ has a longer tail than dāl. In the Aramaic and Hebrew square alphabet, resh is a rounded single stroke while dalet is a right-angle of two strokes. The similarity led to the variant spellings of the name Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadrezzar. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek rho (Ρ/ρ), Etruscan , Latin R, and Cyrillic Р. </li> </ol>"
82,5,"+ <ol> <li> Taw, tav, or taf is the twenty-second and last letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician tāw 𐤕, Hebrew tav ת, Aramaic taw 𐡕‎, Syriac taw ܬ, and Arabic tāʾ ت (22nd in abjadi order, 3rd in modern order). In Arabic, it also gives rise to the derived letter ث ṯāʾ. Its original sound value is /t/. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek tau (Τ), Latin T, and Cyrillic Т. </li> </ol>"

36,5,"+ Hiriq, also called Chirik (Hebrew: חִירִיק ḥiriq  IPA: [χiˈʁik]) is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign represented by a single dot ⟨ ִ‎ ⟩ underneath the letter. In Modern Hebrew, it indicates the phoneme /i/ which is similar to the "" ee "" sound in the English word deep and is transliterated with "" i "". In Yiddish, it indicates the phoneme /ɪ/ which is the same as the "" i"" sound in the English word skip and is transliterated with "" i ""."
19,5,"+ Munach (Hebrew: מֻנַּח, also spelled Munah or Munakh), translated into English as ""to rest"", is a common cantillation sound. In Sfaradi and Eastern traditions, it is often called shofar horek. It is marked with a right angle below the corresponding word. Munaha is found in various groups, including the Caton, Etnaftah, and Segol groups. One or more munaha may be followed by various figurative sounds, such as zakef katon, etnaftah, livia, zarka, segor, and pazel. It is typically used when the number of syllables in a phrase is too long and additional notes are needed to accommodate all the syllables. Munach is usually a short note. However, if it is the first of two munachs following Livia, it has a longer melody. In this case, it may also be called legalme (מֻנַּח לְגַרְמֵ֣הּ׀)."
33,5,"+ In Modern Hebrew, segol makes the same sound as tzere, as does the Hataf Segol (Hebrew: חֲטַף סֶגּוֹל   IPA: [ħaˈtaf seˈɡol], "" Reduced Segol "").

Its sound value is the voiceless glottal fricative ([h]). </li> <li> The proto-Canaanite letter gave rise to the Greek Epsilon Ε ε, Etruscan 𐌄, Latin E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, Ё, Є, Э, and Ҩ. He, like all Phoenician letters, represented a consonant, but the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic equivalents have all come to represent vowel sounds. </li> </ol>"

69,5,"+ <ol> <li> In Jewish Mysticism, Mem is the letter of "" water "" (mayim), symbolizing the "" spring "" of the Torah. Just as the waters of an underground spring rise upward from an unknown source to reveal themselves, so does the spring of wisdom rise up from the mysterious Source that is God. "" The words a man speaks are deep waters, A flowing stream, a fountain of wisdom. "" (Proverbs 18:4). </li> <li> Traditionally, Mem has several related meanings: "" waters,"" "" people, "" "" nations, "" "" languages, "" and "" tongues. "" The name of the letter probably signifies water itself, and its most ancient forms bore a resemblance to waves of water. As such, Mem represents the sea of Torah, the ocean of Talmud, knowledge, wisdom, etc. </li> <li> + The open form (pesucha) is said to represent the revealed truth of God (as demonstrated by Moses), whereas the closed form (stumah) is said to represent the concealed truth of God (as demonstrated by the Mashiach, the revealer of mysteries). </li> <li> As indicated above, the letter Mem is composed of two parts: a Vav and a Kaf. The gematria of these parts is 26, the same value for the sacred Name YHVH. In traditional Hebrew gematria, Mem has the value of 40. </li> <li> A Hebrew Name of God is makom, meaning "" place."" Note that this Name includes both an open and a closed Mem: The sages have taught that God's Presence is both open and revelatory, yet is also shrouded in deep mystery, closed off to the apprehension of human reason. </li> </ol>"
39,5,"<ol> <li> Pataḥ (Hebrew: פַּתָּח patákh, IPA: [paˈtaχ], Biblical Hebrew: pattā́ḥ) is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign represented by a horizontal line ⟨ אַ‎ ⟩ underneath a letter. In modern Hebrew, it indicates the phoneme /a/ which is close to the ""[a] "" sound in the English word far and is transliterated as an a. </li> <li> In Modern Hebrew, a pataḥ makes the same sound as a qamatz, as does the ḥaṭaf pataḥ (Hebrew: חֲטַף פַּתַח IPA: [ħaˈtaf paˈtaħ], ""reduced pataḥ""). The reduced (or ḥaṭaf) niqqud exist for pataḥ, qamatz, and segol which contain a shva next to it. </li> <li> In Yiddish orthography, a pataḥ (called pasekh in Yiddish) has two uses. The combination of pasekh with the letter aleph, אַ, is used to represent the vowel [a]; the combination of pasekh with a digraph consisting of two yods, ײַ, is used to represent the diphthong [aj]. </li> <li> פַּתָּח refers to: open, doorway, hatch, started, launched, door, began, vent; to open; to unlock; to unwrap; to turn on (a light, electrical appliance); to split open, to injure, manhole,opening,slot. </li> </ol>"
40,5,"+ Kamatz or qamatz (Modern Hebrew: קָמָץ, IPA: [kaˈmats]; alternatively קָמֶץ qāmeṣ) is a Hebrew niqqud (vowel) sign represented by two perpendicular lines (looking like an uppercase T) ⟨ ָ ‎ ⟩ underneath a letter. In modern Hebrew, it usually indicates the phoneme /a/ which is the "" a "" sound in the word spa and is transliterated as a . In these cases, its sound is identical to the sound of pataḥ in modern Hebrew. In a minority of cases it indicates the phoneme /o/, equal to the sound of ḥolam. In traditional Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation, qamatz is pronounced as the phoneme /ɔ/, which becomes /u/ in some contexts in southern Ashkenazi dialects.קָמֶץ refers to clench."
61,5,"<ol> <li> Waw (wāw ""hook"") is the sixth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician wāw 𐤅, Aramaic waw 𐡅, Hebrew vav ו, Syriac waw ܘ and Arabic wāw و (sixth in abjadi order; 27th in modern Arabic order). </li> <li> It represents the consonant [w] in classical Hebrew, and [v] in modern Hebrew, as well as the vowels [u] and [o]. In text with niqqud, a dot is added to the left or on top of the letter to indicate, respectively, the two vowel pronunciations. </li> <li> It is the origin of Greek Ϝ (digamma) and Υ (upsilon), Cyrillic У, Latin F and V and later Y, and the derived Latin- or Roman-alphabet letters U, and W. וָו refers to nail, peg, add, ""and"", tent peg, secure, hook. </li> </ol>"
32,5,"+<ol> <li> Shva or, in Biblical Hebrew, shĕwa (Hebrew: שְׁוָא) is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign written as two vertical dots ( ְ ) beneath a letter. It indicates either the phoneme /ə/ (shva na', mobile shva) or the complete absence of a vowel (/Ø/) (shva nach, resting shva). </li> <li> It is transliterated as ⟨e⟩, ⟨ĕ⟩, ⟨ə⟩, ⟨'⟩ (apostrophe), or nothing. Note that use of ⟨ə⟩ for shva is questionable: transliterating Modern Hebrew shva nach with ⟨ə⟩ is misleading, since it is never actually pronounced [ə] – the vowel [ə] does not exist in Modern Hebrew. Moreover, the vowel [ə] is probably not characteristic of earlier pronunciations such as Tiberian vocalization. </li> <li> A shva sign in combination with the vowel diacritics patáẖ, segól and kamáts katán produces a ẖatáf: a diacritic for a tnuʿá ẖatufá (a 'reduced vowel' – lit. 'abducted'). שְׁוָא refers to falsehood, futility; (literary) vanity, emptiness. </li> </ol>"
41,5,"<ol> <li> Holam or Cholam (modern Hebrew: חוֹלָם‎, IPA: [χoˈlam], formerly חֹלֶם‎, ḥōlem) is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign represented by a dot above the upper left corner of the consonant letter. For example, here the holam appears after the letter mem ⟨מ‎⟩‎: מֹ‎. In modern Hebrew, it indicates the mid back rounded vowel, [o̞], and is transliterated as an o. </li> <li> The mater lectionis letter which is usually employed with holam is vav, although in a few words, the letters alef or he are used instead of vav. When it is used with a mater lectionis, the holam is called holam male (חוֹלָם מָלֵא‎, IPA: [χoˈlam maˈle], "" full holam ""), and without it the holam is called holam haser (חוֹלָם חָסֵר‎, IPA: [χoˈlam χaˈser], ""deficient holam""), חוֹלֶם refers to dreamer. </li> </ol>"
38,5,"+ Segol (modern Hebrew: סֶגּוֹל, IPA: [seˈɡol]; formerly סְגוֹל‎, səḡôl) is a Hebrew niqqud vowel sign that is represented by three dots forming an upside down equilateral triangle. As such, it resembles an upside down therefore sign (a because sign) underneath a letter. In modern Hebrew, it indicates the phoneme /e/ which is similar to e in the English word sound in sell and is transliterated as an e. סֶגוֹל refers to purple, violet."
77,5,"<ol> <li> Tsade (also spelled ṣade, ṣādē, ṣaddi, ṣad, tzadi, sadhe, tzaddik) is the eighteenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician ṣādē 𐤑, Hebrew ṣādī צ, Aramaic ṣāḏē 𐡑, Syriac ṣāḏē ܨ, Ge'ez ṣädäy ጸ, and Arabic ṣād ص. Its oldest phonetic value is debated, although there is a variety of pronunciations in different modern Semitic languages and their dialects. It represents the coalescence of three Proto-Semitic ""emphatic consonants"" in Canaanite. Arabic, which kept the phonemes separate, introduced variants of ṣād and ṭāʾ to express the three (see ḍād, ẓāʾ). In Aramaic, these emphatic consonants coalesced instead with ʿayin and ṭēt, respectively, thus Hebrew ereṣ ארץ (earth) is araʿ ארע in Aramaic. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter is continued in the Greek san (Ϻ) and possibly sampi (Ϡ), and in Etruscan 𐌑 Ś. It may have inspired the form of the letter tse in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets. </li> <li> The corresponding letter of the Ugaritic alphabet is 𐎕 ṣade. </li> <li> The letter is named ""tsadek"" in Yiddish, and Hebrew speakers often give it a similar name as well. This name for the letter probably originated from a fast recitation of the alphabet (i.e., ""tsadi, qoph"" → ""tsadiq, qoph""), influenced by the Hebrew word tzadik, meaning "" righteous person, man on side, desire, need, trail, journey, chase, hunt "". </li> </ol>"
9,5,"<ol> <li> Pashta (Hebrew: פַּשְׁטָא‎) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is part of the Katan group. Its mark symbol is identical to that of the Kadma. </li> <li> While Kadma and Pashta use the same symbol, Pashta is distinct from Kadma in the placement of the symbol. Kadma is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter as well as on the accented syllable, if it's not the last. </li> <li> The Hebrew word פַּשְׁטָא֙‎ translates into English as stretching out. פִּשֵּׁט means simplify, to remove (one's clothing); to skin (an animal); to reach out, (one's hand, arm, leg) ; to raid; to spread, to extend </li> </ol>"
4,5,"+ <ol> <li> Zakef Katan (Hebrew: זָקֵף קָטָ֔ן literally 'upright small'; various romanizations), often referred to simply as katan, is a cantillation mark commonly found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. The note is the anchor and final one of the Katon group, which also can include the Mapach, Pashta, Munach, or Yetiv. It is one of the most common cantillation marks. There is no limit to the number of times the Katan group can appear in a verse, and often, multiple Katan groups appear in succession. The most times in succession the group occurs is four. </li> <li> The symbol for the Zakef katan is a colon (:). It is placed on the syllable of the word that is accented. </li> <li> Zakef katan occurs in the Torah 6992 times. </li> <li> Zakef katan is one of two versions of the Zakef trope, the other being Zakef gadol. </li> <li> זקף means to straighten up; to credit, to attribute; (finance) to credit (to an account), to perk, square up, to smile. while קטן means small, little; young; minute, insignificant, inconsequential; diminutive, wee; minor, tiny. </li> </ol>"
63,5,"+ <ol> <li> Heth, sometimes written Chet, but more accurately Ḥet, is the eighth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician ḥēt 𐤇, Hebrew ḥēt ח, Aramaic ḥēṯ 𐡇, Syriac ḥēṯ ܚ, and Arabic ḥāʾ ح. </li> <li> Heth originally represented a voiceless fricative, either pharyngeal /ħ/, or velar /x/. In Arabic, two corresponding letters were created for both phonemic sounds: unmodified ḥāʾ ح represents /ħ/, while ḫāʾ خ represents /x/. </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek eta Η, Etruscan , Latin H, and Cyrillic И. While H is a consonant in the Latin alphabet, the Greek and Cyrillic equivalents represent vowel sounds, though the letter was originally a consonant in Greek and this usage later evolved into the rough breathing character. </li> <li> ח refers to tent wall, fence, separation, wall, outside, divide, half </li> </ol>"
66,5,"<ol> <li> Kaph (also spelled kaf) is the eleventh letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician kāp 𐤊, Hebrew kāp̄ כ, Aramaic kāp 𐡊, Syriac kāp̄ ܟ, and Arabic kāf ك (in abjadi order). </li> <li> The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek kappa (Κ), Latin K, and Cyrillic К. </li>  <li> כ refers to palm of hand, to open, open palm, bend, open, allow, tame </li> </ol>"
74,5,"<ol> <li> Ayin (also ayn or ain; transliterated ⟨ʿ⟩) is the sixteenth letter of the Semitic scripts, including Phoenician ʿayin 𐤏, Hebrew ʿayin ע, Aramaic ʿē 𐡏, Syriac ʿē ܥ, and Arabic ʿayn ع (where it is sixteenth in abjadi order only). </li> <li> The letter represents a voiced pharyngeal fricative (/ʕ/) or a similarly articulated consonant. In some Semitic languages and dialects, the phonetic value of the letter has changed, or the phoneme has been lost altogether (thus, in the revived Modern Hebrew it is reduced to a glottal stop or is omitted entirely in part due to European influence). </li> <li> The Phoenician letter is the origin of the Greek, Latin and Cyrillic letter O, O and O. </li> <li> It is also the origin of letter Ƹ. </li> <li> ע refers to eye, see, watch, know, shade, to see, experience. </li> </ol>"
76,5,"<ol> <li> Pe is the seventeenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician pē 𐤐, Hebrew pē פ, Aramaic pē 𐡐, Syriac pē ܦ, and Arabic fāʾ ف (in abjadi order). </li> <li> The original sound value is a voiceless bilabial plosive: /p/; it retains this value in most Semitic languages, except for Arabic, where the sound /p/ changed into the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/, carrying with it the pronunciation of the letter. Not to be confused with the Turned g. The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Pi (Π), Latin P, and Cyrillic П. </li> <li> פ refers mouth, word, speak, open, blow, scatter, edge.</li> </ol>"

87,5,"+ Geresh (׳ in Hebrew: גֶּרֶשׁ‎‎ or גֵּרֶשׁ‎‎ [ˈɡeʁeʃ], or medieval [ˈɡeːɾeːʃ]) is a sign in Hebrew writing."
88,5,"+ Gershayim (Hebrew: גֵּרְשַׁיִם‎, without niqqud גרשיים‎), also occasionally grashayim (גְּרָשַׁיִם‎), is two distinct typographical marks in the Hebrew language."
88,5,"+ The name literally means ""double geresh""."

47,2,"→ In some siddurs (e.g. those printed by ArtScroll) a diacritical symbol, typographically the same as the rafe, but utterly unrelated, is used to mark instances of ""moving sheva"" (Shva Na)."
47,5,"+ In Hebrew orthography the rafe or raphe (Hebrew: רָפֶה, pronounced [ʁaˈfe], meaning ""(literary) weak, limp; (grammar) lax"") is a diacritic (⟨ ֿ‎ ⟩), a subtle horizontal overbar placed above certain letters to indicate that they are to be pronounced as fricatives."
47,5,"+ It originated with the Tiberian Masoretes as part of the extended system of niqqud (vowel points), and has the opposite meaning of dagesh qal, showing that one of the letters בגדכפת is to be pronounced as a fricative and not as a plosive, or (sometimes) that a consonant is single and not double; or, as the opposite to a mappiq, to show that the letters ה or א are silent (mater lectionis)."
47,5,"+ The rafe generally fell out of use for Hebrew with the coming of printing, although according to Gesenius (1813) at that time it could still be found in a few places in printed Hebrew Bibles, where the absence of a dagesh or a mappiq was noticeable. (e.g. Exodus 20:13,14,15; Deuteronomy 5:13,17,18,19; 2 Samuel 11:1; Isaiah 22:10; Jeremiah 20:17; Psalm 119:99; Zechariah 5:11)"
47,3,"≈ The rafe is similar in function to the buailte (dot above, denoting lenition) in the old-style Irish alphabet."

51,5,"+ The sof passuk (Hebrew: סוֹף פָּסוּק‎, end of verse, also spelled sof pasuq and other variant English spellings, and sometimes called סילוק silluq) is the cantillation mark that occurs on the last word of every verse, or passuk, in the Tanakh. Some short verses contain only members of the sof passuk group."
51,5,"+ The sof passuk can be preceded by the marks mercha, tipcha, and mercha in that order, including either all or some of these. However, these merchot and tipchot do not necessarily have the same melody as those in the etnachta group. Altogether, there are five possible arrangements how these can appear."
2,5,"+ Segol (Hebrew: סְגוֹל֒   also known as Segolta, with variant English spellings), is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. "
2,5,"+ The Segol occurs together with a preceding Zarka, sometimes with a Munach preceding one or both."
2,5,"+ The Segol group is considered to be a disjunctive. It occurs in place of the Katan group or a Zakef gadol. It is the strongest disjunctive group ahead of the Etnachta group."
2,5,"+ The Hebrew word סְגוֹל֒ translates into English as bunch, referring to a bunch of grapes. This is reflected in its appearance as a three-dot symbol."
2,5,"+ The Israel people are called “am segulah,”a chosen people. "
2,5,"+ The segol represents the Sefirah of Chessed1—kindness—and is displayed as a triangle of three dots: right, left and center."
8,5,"+ Zarka or zarqa (Hebrew: זַרְקָא֮, with variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is usually found together with the Segol, with a Munach preceding either or both. The symbol for a Zarka is a 90 degrees rotated, inverted S. "
8,5,"+ The Hebrew word זַרְקָא֮‎ translates as ""throwing"" and the melody is ascending in Moroccan and Sefardic tradition (with two or one retracements respectively) and descending in the Ashkenazic."
8,5,"+ Zarka is part of the Segol group. In this group, Zarka is the connector and Segol is the separator."
8,5,"+ Zarqa, written postpositive to the word, is a distinctive accent used in 21 books of the Bible. "
8,5,"+ The same accent, also postpositive and also distinctive, is called Tsinor in the other 3 books."
8,5,"+ Such postpositive accents are usually positioned above left of the last letter of the word, but sometimes one may find them also on top of the last letter, with no effect on semantics."
30,5,"+ Tsinnorit (Hebrew: צִנּוֹרִת֘) is a cantillation mark in the Hebrew Bible, found at the 3 poetic books, also known as the א״מת books (Job or אִיוֹב in Hebrew, Proverbs or מִשְלֵי, and Psalms or תְהִלִּים). "
30,5,"+ It looks like a 90-degrees rotated, inverted S, placed on top of a Hebrew consonant. "
9,5,"+ Pashta (Hebrew: פַּשְׁטָא֙‎) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is part of the Katan group. Its mark symbol is identical to that of the Kadma."
9,5,"While Kadma and Pashta use the same symbol, Pashta is distinct from Kadma in the placement of the symbol. Kadma is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter as well as on the accented syllable, if it's not the last."
9,5,"The Hebrew word פַּשְׁטָא֙‎ translates into English as stretching out."
24,5,"+ Kadma (Hebrew קַדְמָ֨א, with variant English spellings) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It can be found by itself preceding certain trope groups, or together with a Geresh, in which case, the pair is known as ""Kadma-V'Azla."""
24,5,"Kadma has the same symbol as the Pashta, though Kadma is distinct from Pashta in the placement of the symbol. In a Kadma, the symbol is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter and also on the accented syllable if the last syllable is not the accented one."
24,5,"The symbols for Kadma V'Azla are designed to resemble the fingers of an outstretched hand in a curved position."
24,5,"The Kadma-V'Azla pair occurs 1733 times in the Torah."
24,5,"The word Kadma is related to the Hebrew קדמה (kedma), east. It is also related to the root קדם, front. The combination of these words translates to going away."
16,5,"+ Telisha (Hebrew: תְּלִישָא‎) is one of two cantillation marks found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. "
16,5,"+ There are two versions of the Telisha: Telisha ketana (תְּ֩לִישָא קְטַנָּה‎) and Telisha gedola (תְּ֠לִישָא גְּדוֹלָה‎), the latter of which has a longer melody and higher peak. "
16,5,"+ The Telisha trope can occur independently or can follow a Pazer or one of several other trope sounds."
16,5,"+ The Hebrew word  תְּלִישָא‎ translates into English as detached. This is because they are never linked to the following note as a single phrase. "
16,5,"‎+ קְטַנָּה refers to little (the shorter note) and גְדוֹלָה‎ to great (the longer note)."
16,5,"‎+ תְּלִישָא refers to 1.pull out, 2.rip, 3.detached"
16,5,"‎+ גְדוֹלָה refers to greatness, importance, major, big, great."
16,5,"+ The Telisha gedola can be found in the Torah 266 times. The Telisha ketana occurs 451 times."
25,2,"→ 05A0 HEBREW ACCENT TELISHA GEDOLA תְּ֠לִישָא גְּדוֹלָה"
25,5,"+ The Telisha ketana must be followed by a Kadma."
25,5,"‎+ קְטַנָּה refers to a)1.small, 2.little; b)1.young; c)1.minute, 2.insignificant, 3.inconsequential; d)1.diminutive"
48,5,"+ Hebrew punctuation is similar to that of English and other Western languages, Modern Hebrew having imported additional punctuation marks from these languages in order to avoid the ambiguities sometimes occasioned by the relative paucity of such symbols in Biblical Hebrew."
48,5,"+ ‎פָּסֵק refers to a)1.to cease, 2.to stop; b)1.to desist"
10,5,"+ Yetiv (יְ֚תִיב) is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. "
10,5,"+ It is found in the Katon group in some occurrences in lieu of the more common Mahpach-Pashta clause, generally on one- or two-syllable words."
10,5,"+ The Yetiv uses the same < symbol as the Mahpach, but when it is present, the < comes at the beginning of the word, unlike in a Mahpach, it is placed under the letter of the first syllable that is stressed. "
10,5,"+ It is found to the right of the vowel. There is also no Pashta. "
10,5,"+ In print, the Yetiv will sometimes be distinguished from the Mahapach by being more acutely angled, but in the identical position."
10,5,"+ Yetiv occurs in the Torah 356 times."
10,5,"+ The Hebrew word יְתִיב translates into English as sitting."
13,5,"+ Hebrew cantillation is the manner of chanting ritual readings from the Hebrew Bible in synagogue services."
13,5,"+ The chants are written and notated in accordance with the special signs or marks printed in the Masoretic Text of the Bible, to complement the letters and vowel points. "
13,5,"+ These marks are known in English as 'accents' (diacritics), 'notes' or trope symbols, and in Hebrew as taʿamei ha-mikra (טעמי המקרא) or just teʿamim (טעמים)."
13,5,"+ Some of these signs were also sometimes used in medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah."
13,5,"+ The musical motifs associated with the signs are known in Hebrew as niggun or neginot (not to be confused with Hasidic nigun) and in Yiddish as trop (טראָפ): the word trope is sometimes used in Jewish English with the same meaning."
13,5,"+ There are multiple traditions of cantillation. Within each tradition, there are multiple tropes, typically for different books of the Bible and often for different occasions. "
13,5,"+ For example, different chants may be used for Torah readings on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur than for the same text on a normal Shabbat."
13,5,"‎+ מֻקְדָּם refers to  a)1.coefficient; b)1. advance, 2.premature; 2.origin, 3.early, 4. to welcome; c)1.sponsor; d)1.lobby for; e)1.promote"
45,5,"+ Meteg (or meseg or metheg, Hebrew: מֶתֶֽג‎, lit. 'bridle', also gaʿya געיה‎, lit. 'bellowing', מאריך‎ maʾarikh, or מעמיד‎ maʿamid) is a punctuation mark used in Biblical Hebrew for stress marking. "
45,5,"+ It is a vertical bar placed under the affected syllable."
27,5,"+ Ole (Hebrew: עוֹלֶה‎) a cantillation mark found in Psalms, Proverbs, and Job (the אמ""ת books). Ole is also sometimes used as a stress marker in texts without cantillation."
13,5,"‎+ עוֹלֶה refers to a)1.immigrant (to Israel); b)1.getting on, going up; c)1.offense, 2.wrongdoing, 3.cost, 4.burnt offering, 5.fire; d)1.increase, 2.rising, 3.exceeded, 4.outranked; e)1.coming up, 2.consistent, 3.is working, 4.mind, 5.loading, 6.shown, 7.apparent."
28,5,"+ The Illuy or Iluy (Hebrew: עִלּוּי‎) is a Trope (from Yiddish טראָפּ ""trop"") in the Judaic Liturgy. "
13,5,"+ It is one of the cantillation marks used in the three poetic books: Job, the Book of Proverbs, and the Psalms. Accordingly, it is a special mark belonging to the Ta'amei Sifrei Emet (meaning, the accent signs of the books of truth)."
13,5,"‎+ עִלּוּי refers to a)1.genius; b)1.prodigy"
3,5,"+ The Shalshelet (Hebrew: שַלְשֶלֶת‎) is a cantillation mark found in the Torah. It is one of the rarest used, occurring just four times in the entire Torah, in Genesis 19:16, 24:12, and 39:8, and in Leviticus 8:23. The four words accented with the shalshelet mark all occur at the beginning of the verse."
3,5,"+ The Hebrew word שַׁלְשֶׁ֓לֶת translates into English as chain. This shows the connection of the worlds by the links of a chain. The symbolism of the Shalshelet is that the subject of the story is wrestling with his inner demons and is undergoing some hesitation in his actions."
3,5,"+ It is rendered musically by a long and elaborate string of notes, giving a strong emphasis to the word on which it occurs."
3,5,"‎+ שַלְשֶלֶת refers to a)1.(literary) heavy chain; b)1.development, 2.chain of events; c)1.(biology) spirochete"
20,5,"+ Mahpach (Hebrew מַהְפַּ֤ך, with variant English spellings) is a common cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is part of the Katan group, and it frequently begins the group. The symbol for the Mahpach is <."
20,5,"+ Mahpach is always followed by a Pashta. This is because Mahpach is a conjunctive, showing a connection with the word that follows."
20,5,"+ When the Mahpach is found, the < is placed under the syllable that is most heavily stressed."
20,5,"+ The variant Yetiv trope uses the same < symbol as the Mahpach, but does not have a Pashta that follows."
20,5,"+ Mahpach is found in the Torah 3042 times."
20,5,"+ The Hebrew word מַהְפַּ֤ך translates into English to reversal. "
20,5,"+ The original symbol looked more like a sideways U than a V (to represent going forward then turning back around), but this was changed because it was easier for printers to print, as modern keyboards have the < symbols."
22,5,"+ Mercha kefula (מֵרְכָא כְּפוּלָ֦ה, with variant English spellings) is a rare cantillation mark that occurs 5 times in the Torah (once in Genesis, once in Exodus, once in Leviticus, and twice in Numbers) and once in the Haftarah (for Behaalotecha and for the intermediate Shabbat for Chanukah, in the Book of Zechariah.)"
22,5,"+ The Hebrew words מֵרְכָא כְּפוּלָ֦ה translate into English as double mercha. This name is given since the mark that is used appears like two merchas."
22,5,"‎+ כְּפוּלָה refers to a)1.double, dual, twice; b)1.(mathematics) multiple"
6,5,"+ Tifcha (Hebrew: טִפְחָ֖א, also spelled Tifkha, Tipcha and other variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark commonly found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books that are chanted. "
6,5,"+ In Sephardic and Oriental traditions, it is called Tarcha, meaning ""dragging"" or ""effort""."
6,5,"+ The Tifcha is found in both the Etnachta group as the second member of that group, and in the Sof passuk group, though the melody varies slightly in each. While it is a weak sound, it is considered to be stronger than a Tevir"
6,5,"+ The Hebrew word טִפְחָ֖א translates into English as diagonal. It is related to the word tefach (טפח, measurement of the palm). "
6,5,"+ The tifcha does not have a separating value of its own, as it is in the middle of a set of words."
6,5,"+ Tifcha occurs in the Torah 11,285 times, more than any other trope sound. Tifcha is the only trope sound to appear more than 10,000 times in the Torah."
6,5,"+ The first word of the Torah בראשית (Bereshit) is on a Tifcha."
6,5,"‎+ טִפְחָ֖א refers to ""hand-breadth""."
30,5,"+ Tsinnorit is very similar in shape to Zarka (called tsinnor in the poetic books), but is used differently. It is always combined with a second mark to form a conjunctive symbol:"
30,5,"+ Tsinnorit combines with (merkha to form merkha metsunneret, a rare variant of merkha that serves mainly sof pasuq."
30,5,"+ Tsinnorit combines with mahapakh to form mehuppakh metsunnar, also a rare mark, variant of mahapakh that serves mainly azla legarmeh but appears also in the other contexts where mahapakh and illuy appear."
30,5,"+ This mark has been wrongly named by Unicode. Zarqa/tsinnor corresponds to Unicode ""Hebrew accent zinor"", code point U+05AE (where ""zinor"" is a misspelled form for tsinnor), while tsinnorit maps to ""Hebrew accent zarqa"", code point U+0598."
30,5,"+ tsinnor (Hebrew, pipe or shaft) mentioned in the Bible in the description of David's conquest of the city (II Samuel 5:8)"
30,5,"+ AV - gutter 1, waterspout 1; 2"
30,5,"+ 1) pipe, spout, conduit, water conduit"
30,5,"+ Tsinorit, written on top of a consonant in the beginning or the middle of the word, is a conjunctive accent in the 3 books."
30,5,"+ The names Tsinor and Tsinorit are both written with initial TSADI (U+05E6) and not with initial ZAYIN (U+05D6). Following the transcription for all other Hebrew names in Unicode, they should therefore be written with initial ""TS-"" instead of initial ""Z-""."
30,5,"+ Geminated consonants are never reflected in the transcription used for Unicode character names; therefore we write here consistently ""Tsinor"" and ""Tsinorit"" instead of the transcription ""Tsinnor(it)"" in the other chapters of this article."
27,5,"Ole (Hebrew: ‎ עוֹלֶ֫ה) a cantillation mark found in Psalms, Proverbs, and Job (the אמ""ת‎ books). Ole is also sometimes used as a stress marker in texts without cantillation.It refers to immigrant (to Israel), burnt offering, outranked."

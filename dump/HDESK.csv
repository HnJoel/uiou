1,5,"the statement that God created is marked with an Etnachta, showing the completion of God’s creation, אֱלֹהִ֑ים. The Hebrew word אֶתְנַחְתָּא translates into English as pause.This name is given because of its central location within a verse."
2,5,"The Hebrew word סְגוֹל֒ translates into English as bunch, referring to a bunch of grapes. This is reflected in its appearance as a three-dot symbol."
3,5,"The Hebrew word שַׁלְשֶׁ֓לֶת translates into English as chain. This shows the connection of the worlds by the links of a chain. The symbolism of the Shalshelet is that the subject of the story is wrestling with his inner demons and is undergoing some hesitation in his actions."
4,5,"Zakef Katan (Hebrew: זָקֵף קָטָ֔ן literally 'upright small'; various romanizations), often referred to simply as katan. The note is the anchor and final one of the Katon group. There is no limit to the number of times the Katan group can appear in a verse, and often, multiple Katan groups appear in succession. The most times in succession the group occurs is four. זקף means to straighten up; while קטן means small, little."
5,5,"The Zakef gadol generally functions as a separator between two segments of a verse. Words that bear the zakef gadol are generally short with no preceding conjunctive. It is used in situations where a Zakef katon would be expected, but where there is only a single word.The Hebrew word זָקֵף translates into English as upright. גָּד֕וֹל translates as large."
6,5,"In Sephardic and Oriental traditions, it is called Tarcha, meaning ""dragging"" or ""effort"".The Tifcha is found in both the Etnachta group as the second member of that group, and in the Sof passuk group, though the melody varies slightly in each. While it is a weak sound, it is considered to be stronger than a Tevir.The Hebrew word טִפְחָ֖א translates into English as diagonal. It is related to the word tefach (טפח, measurement of the palm). The tifcha does not have a separating value of its own, as it is in the middle of a set of words.The first word of the Torah בראשית (Bereshit) is on a Tifcha."
7,5,"It is commonly explained as being the Aramaic equivalent of Hebrew רְבִיעִי‎ Revi'i, meaning 'fourth' or 'quarter'., and for that reason is sometimes called Revi'i. However, this is probably a folk etymology: the more likely meaning in Aramaic is ""crouching"" or ""lying"", referring to its position vertically above the word.Revia is considered to have medium strength. It is stronger than a Pashta or Tevir, but weaker than a Zakef or Tifcha.Revia can occur either by itself, or following one or two Munachs. When there are two Munachs prior to a Revia, the first Munach has a long melody, and the second one is short. When there is one Munach, it is short.Based on its translation as fourth, in printed texts it is represented by a diamond-shaped mark. However in manuscripts it is just a dot."
8,5,"Tsinnorit (Hebrew צִנּוֹרִת֘, Tsinorit) is a cantillation mark in the Hebrew Bible,written on top of a consonant in the beginning or the middle of the word, is a conjunctive accent in the 3 books. It is always combined with a second mark to form a conjunctive symbol.This mark has been wrongly named by Unicode. Zarqa/tsinnor corresponds to Unicode ""Hebrew accent zinor"", code point U+05AE (where ""zinor"" is a misspelled form for tsinnor), while tsinnorit maps to ""Hebrew accent zarqa"", code point U+0598. צִנּוֹרִת֘ means crochet hook."
9,5,"It is part of the Katan group. Its mark symbol is identical to that of the Kadma.While Kadma and Pashta use the same symbol, Pashta is distinct from Kadma in the placement of the symbol. Kadma is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter as well as on the accented syllable, if it's not the last.The Hebrew word פַּשְׁטָא֙‎ translates into English as stretching out. פִּשֵּׁט means simplify, to remove (one's clothing); to skin (an animal); to reach out, (one's hand, arm, leg) ; to raid; to spread, to extend."
10,5,"It is found in the Katon group in some occurrences in lieu of the more common Mahpach-Pashta clause, generally on one- or two-syllable words.The Yetiv uses the same < symbol as the Mahpach, but when it is present, the < comes at the beginning of the word, unlike in a Mahpach, it is placed under the letter of the first syllable that is stressed. It is found to the right of the vowel. There is also no Pashta. In print, the Yetiv will sometimes be distinguished from the Mahapach by being more acutely angled, but in the identical position.The Hebrew word יְ֚תִיב translates into English as sitting."
11,5,"It can be found independently or it can follow any number of other cantillation marks, very commonly a Mercha or Darga.The Hebrew word תְּבִ֛יר translates into English as broken."
12,5,"It is most often found together with the Kadma, in which case the pair is known as Kadma-V'Azla, but it can also be found independently, in which case it is referred to as Azla Geresh or simply as Geresh.The Hebrew word גֵּ֜רֵשׁ‎ translates into English as driving out, expatriate or divorce, drive away (forth, out), expel, deport, X surely put away, trouble, thrust out, apostrophe, banish, chase away, expel, to leave, oust."

14,5,"The Hebrew word גֵּרְשַׁ֞יִם‎ translates into English as double geresh."
15,5,"Karne parah (Hebrew: קַרְנֵי פָרָה‎, also spelled Qarnei Farah and other variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark found only once in the entire Torah (Book of Numbers Numbers] 35:5), and once in the Book of Esther, immediately following the identically unique Yerach ben yomo.The symbol of the Karne para is that of the Telisha ketana and gedola together. The melody, likewise, is that of these two more common cantillation sounds put together.The Hebrew words קַרְנֵי פָרָ֟ה translate into English as cow's horns. קַרְנֵי refers to horny, radiated, antlers, laser, ray, sunlight, beam; פָרָ֟ה refers to ox, calf, cattle, cow, manatee, sea cow, sirenian, ladybird, ladybug, milker, milch cow."
16,5,"There are two versions of the Telisha: Telisha ketana (תְּלִישָא קְטַנָּה‎) and Telisha gedola (תְּלִישָא גְּדוֹלָה‎), the latter of which has a longer melody and higher peak. The Telisha trope can occur independently or can follow a Pazer or one of several other trope sounds. The Telisha ketana must be followed by a Kadma.The Hebrew word  תְּ֠לִישָא‎ translates into English as detached. This is because they are never linked to the following note as a single phrase. קְטַנָּה‎ refers to little (the shorter note) and גְדוֹלָה‎ to great (the longer note). תְּלִישָא refers to 1.pull out, 2.rip, 3.detached; גְדוֹלָה refers to greatness, importance, major, big, great."
17,5,"The pazer is generally followed by a Telisha ketana or gedola; on rare occasions when it is followed by another Pazer.The Pazer is used to prolong a word significantly during the reading. This places strong emphasis on the meaning of the particular word.The Hebrew word פָּזֵ֡ר translates into English as distribute or disseminate. This relates to the high number of notes in its melody. In a mystical interpretation, it shows the distribution of divinity. It has meanings of scatter, disperse, strew, spread, sprinkle, split."
18,5,"‎אַתְנַח refers to pause; while הָפוּךְ refers to reversed, inverted, inverse; opposite; in disarray; upside down; backward."
19,5,"The Munach (Hebrew: מֻנַּח‎, also spelled Munah or Munakh), translating to English as to rest, (music) position, comfort, pitch. In Sephardi and Oriental traditions it is often called Shofar holekh. It is marked with a right angle below the corresponding word. The munach is found in various groups, including the Katon, Etnachta, and Segol groups. One or more munachs can be followed by many different trope sounds, including Zakef katon, Etnachta, Rivia, Zarka, Segol, and Pazer. It is normally used when the number of syllables in a phrase are so long that an extra note is required to accommodate all the syllables.The munach is normally a short note. But when it is the first of two munachs followed by a Rivia, it has a longer melody. In this case it may also be called legarmeh (מֻנַּח לְגַרְמֵ֣הּ׀)."
20,5,"It is part of the Katan group, and it frequently begins the group. The symbol for the Mahpach is <. Mahpach is always followed by a pashta. This is because Mahpach is a conjunctive, showing a connection with the word that follows. When the Mahpach is found, the < is placed under the syllable that is most heavily stressed. The variant Yetiv trope uses the same < symbol as the Mahpach, but does not have a Pashta that follows.The Hebrew word מַהְפַּ֤ך translates into English to reversal, revolution, dramatic change; turnover, upset; (slang) makeover; (geography) tropic. The original symbol looked more like a sideways U than a V (to represent going forward then turning back around), but this was changed because it was easier for printers to print, as modern keyboards have the < symbols."
21,5,"Mercha is found in several trope groups, though the melody varies from one use to the next. It is the beginning of the Etnachta group, can be found either once or twice preceding the Sof passuk, or can occasionally precede the Pashta in the Katon group or a Tevir.The Hebrew word מֵרְכָ֥א translates into English as mercha, comma. מֵרְכָא refers to : quotation mark. מרך refers to coordinator, soft. "
22,5,"Mercha kefula (מֵרְכָא כּפוּלָ֦ה, with variant English spellings) is a rare cantillation mark that occurs 5 times in the Torah (once in Genesis, once in Exodus, once in Leviticus, and twice in Numbers) and once in the Haftarah (for Behaalotecha and for the intermediate Shabbat for Chanukah, in the Book of Zechariah.). The Hebrew words מֵרְכָא כּפוּלָ֦ה translate into English as double mercha. This name is given since the mark that is used appears like two merchas. כּפוּלָ֦ה refers to (mathematics) multiple, double, Binary."
23,5,"The symbol for the darga resembles a backwards Z."
23,5,"The symbol for the darga resembles a backwards Z. The darga is usually followed by a Tevir. It is most often found in places where a Tevir clause has two words which are closely related. The Hebrew word דַּרְגָּא translates into English as step. With the Hebrew word tevir meaning ""broken, "" the combination of darga tevir means ""broken step.""Darga can also be followed by a Munach Rivia, and can (rarely) be followed by a Mercha Kefula, an altogether rare trope."
24,5,"Kadma (Hebrew קַדְמָ֨א, with variant English spellings). It can be found by itself preceding certain trope groups, or together with a Geresh, in which case, the pair is known as ""Kadma-V'Azla.""Kadma has the same symbol as the Pashta, though Kadma is distinct from Pashta in the placement of the symbol. In a Kadma, the symbol is always placed on the accented syllable, while Pashta is placed on the last letter and also on the accented syllable if the last syllable is not the accented one. The symbols for Kadma V'Azla are designed to resemble the fingers of an outstretched hand in a curved position.The word Kadma is related to the Hebrew קדמה (kedma), east, predated, preceded, foreground, advancement, progress. It is also related to the root קדם, front. The combination of these words translates to going away. קֶדֶם means קדמה -(literary) eastward, ancient times, east (literary)."
25,5,"The Telisha ketana must be followed by a Kadma. The Hebrew word ‎תְּ֩לִישָא translates into English as detached. This is because they are never linked to the following note as a single phrase. קְטַנָּה‎ refers to little (the shorter note) and גְדוֹלָה‎ to great (the longer note)."
26,5,"Yerach ben yomo (Hebrew: יֵרֶח בֶּן יוֹמ֪וֹ, with variant English spellings, also known as Galgal), is a cantillation mark that appears only one time in the entire Torah (Numbers 35:5), and once in the Book of Esther. In these occurrences, it is followed immediately by a Karne parah, another mark that is found only once in the entire Torah. The symbol for this trope is an upside-down Etnachta. The Hebrew words יֵרֶח בֶּן יוֹמ֪וֹ‎ translate into English as day-old moon. Its alternate name גלגל‎ translates into English as sphere. יֵרֶח  means moon, moonlight, lunar, months. בֶּן means son, child, boy; member of group (nation, class, family); native; בני - my son, son (usu. term of endearment); הבן - junior, the second (title). יוֹמ֪וֹ day (cf. night); day (calendar day, 24-hour period); ימים - days, period, time; לימים - eventually, in time."

30,5,"Zarka or zarqa (Hebrew: זַרְקָא֮, with variant English spellings) is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is usually found together with the Segol, with a Munach preceding either or both. The symbol for a Zarka is a 90 degrees rotated, inverted S. The Hebrew word זַרְקָא֮‎ translates as "" throwing "" and the melody is ascending in Moroccan and Sefardic tradition (with two or one retracements respectively) and descending in the Ashkenazic. Zarka is part of the Segol group. In this group, Zarka is the connector and Segol is the separator. זָרַק means to throw; to dispose of, to eliminate; (colloquial) to get rid of someone, to rid oneself, dump. tsinnor (Hebrew, pipe or shaft) mentioned in the Bible in the description of David's conquest of the city (II Samuel 5:8), AV - gutter 1, waterspout 1; 2. 1) pipe, spout, conduit, water conduit."
